## Abstract

Perfect Media Server began life as a series of blog posts over at [blog.linuxserver.io](https://blog.linuxserver.io/tag/perfectmediaserver/). Those posts continue to be very popular, but a blog post can only get you so far. Therefore, I introduce perfectmediaserver.com - a wiki format information repository detailing all you need to know to build a free, open, and modular media server that will last for years to come.

The primary technologies we recommend are [Linux](https://www.linux.org/), Containers (via [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and managed using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)), [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/), [MergerFS](https://github.com/trapexit/mergerfs/), [SnapRAID](http://www.snapraid.it/) and [ZFS](https://zfsonlinux.org/).

You can find the original blog series of PMS here:

If you're looking to build a media server, then you've come to the right place. This site documents the many aspects of building a media server using Free and Open Source Software wherever possible. 

## Usage

If writing and wanting to run a local copy of the wiki, run:

```bash
$ docker-compose up --build
```

or

```bash
pip3 -U -r requirements.txt

mkdocs serve
```

In both cases the site will be available at `localhost:8000`. In the docker version though some niceities like auto refresh on save go away.

## Deployment

To deploy the site, push to `main`, and a GitHub action will do the rest.

## Contributing

To contribute, open a PR, and I will review it. Gratefully received!
