## Lian-Li PC-Q25B

The Lian-Li PC-Q25B was released several years ago (not totally sure but it looks like 2013) and is unfortunately no longer in production so far as I can tell. You can find the odd used model popping up on eBay. It supports 5 hot swap 3.5" drives and has space for 2 more non hot swap 3.5" drives in the bottom.

This case was popular in the [unRAID compulsive design](https://www.google.com/search?q=lian+li+pc+q25b+site:forums.unraid.net&sxsrf=ALeKk010EUCoKTRzD-kvP21muTqzIAtB5w:1609223374686&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjc0fKcyPLtAhWIq1kKHSnfCPEQrQIoBHoECAcQBQ&biw=1532&bih=1158) forum and several users posted successful builds if you're after an idea of how the finished product will look.

The above picture is my own personal build from when I lived in a tiny apartment in London and space was at a premium. The diminuitive size of this case made it perfect for apartment living. Sporting only 2 fans (1 120mm and 120/140mm) it was quiet and had a small, but sufficient, amount of airflow meaning that temps were never an issue. 

The build pictured made use of an [ASrock Rack C2750D4I](https://www.asrockrack.com/general/productdetail.asp?Model=C2750D4I#Specifications) board which sadly fell victim to the [C2000 Intel bug](http://forum.asrock.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=4376&title=intels-atom-c2000-chips-are-bricking-products) (of death). A shame really because that motherboard was a fantastic level of price to performance for a media server in those days (2016-2018).
