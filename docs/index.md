Perfect Media Server began life as a series of blog posts over at [blog.linuxserver.io](https://www.linuxserver.io/blog/tag:perfectmediaserver#blog_list). Those posts continue to be very popular but a blog post (or three) can only get you so far... 

I therefore introduce perfectmediaserver.com - a wiki format information repository detailing all you need to know to build a free, open and modular media server that will last for many, many years.

The primary technologies we recommend are [Linux](tech-stack/linux.md), Containers (via [docker](tech-stack/docker.md) and managed using [docker-compose](tech-stack/docker-compose.md)), [Proxmox](tech-stack/proxmox.md), [MergerFS](tech-stack/mergerfs.md), [SnapRAID](tech-stack/snapraid.md) and [ZFS](tech-stack/zfs.md/).

If you're looking to build a media server, then you've come to the right place. This site documents the many aspects of building a media server using Free and Open Source Software wherever possible.

## The aim of this site

The aim is to share knowledge and information about building a media server.

The potential scope of this project could be vast. There are many flavours of Linux, many hypervisors and so on. Therefore, in order that this documentation remains manageable, we only cover a small subset of the options available. However, by sharing the knowledge and thought patterns used to drive our decisions, you will leave armed with the ability to build your own DIY NAS or as we like to call it, the Perfect Media Server.

I doubt this site will ever be "finished" because technologies, budgets, time and priorities change - as they do, I will continue update this site.
